/**
 * @brief The Broker's thread pool.
 *
 * At the origin, this thread pool is configured to be used by ASIO. Each thread
 * in this pool runs an io_context that allows any part in Broker to post
 * a work to be done.
 *
 * This pool may look a little complicated. We can see inside it several
 * attributes, let's make a quick tour of them. A thread pool is an array of
 * threads. This array, here, is a std::vector named _pool.
 *
 * This pool is instanciated through a unique instance. So its constructor is
 * private and we have a static method named instance() to get it.
 *
 * Initially, the pool is not started. To start it, there is a static method
 * named start() that takes one argument: the number of threads.
 *
 * If the start() method is not called before using the pool, broker does not
 * work, at least not as expected. If the given size is 0, its size will be
 * initialized with the number of cpus on the host computer.
 *
 * To post tasks to the pool, we use the ASIO api, for that we need an
 * asio::io_context and an asio::io_service::work which are defined when then
 * pool is constructed.
 *
 * There is a _closed boolean variable used internally to know if the pool is
 * running (and not closed) or stopped (and closed). To work with it, we also
 * use a mutex _closed_m.
 *
 * And to have statistics on that pool, every 10s, we execute a task
 * _check_latency() whose goal is to measure the duration between the time point
 * when we ask to execute a task and the time point when we get its execution.
 * This duration is stored in _latency.
 *
 * We can see a steady_timer in the class, its goal is to cadence this check.
