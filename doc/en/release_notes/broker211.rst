Compatibility with Centreon Engine 1.5
======================================

Centreon Engine 1.5 introduce direct support for Centreon ID. Centreon
Broker 2.11 handle this change and is therefore not compatible with the
1.4 series of Centreon Engine.

Dropped support of Nagios
=========================

Centreon Broker is not officially compatible with Nagios anymore. We
introduced some API changes in Centreon Engine that make it impossible
to maintain compatibility.
