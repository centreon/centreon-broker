Builds
======
Build on Centos8 fixed.

Retention files
===============
The splitter class is now thread safe and does not need external locks anymore.
It is also far less strict and allows some reading and some writing at the same
time.

TCP
===
Writing on a tcp stream could slow down in case of many retention files. The
issue was essentially in the flush internal function.

Enhancements

Command line argument
=====================
It is now possible to set the cbd pool size directly on the command line with
the --pool_size X argument or -s X.

Statistics
==========
The thread pool has now its own statistics. For now, we have two informations
that are the number of threads it contains and its latency in milliseconds that
is the duration we have to wait to see a task executed. We post a task to the
thread pool at time T1, it is executed by the thread pool at time T2, the
latency is T2 - T1.

TCP connections
===============
TCP streams are really faster, especially when broker has retention files and
there are a lot of traffic.

SQL and storage streams
=======================
Those streams have several improvements:
* events exchanges are really faster, especially when broker has retention
  files.
* Several queries have been changed to insert data in bulk, it is the case for
  custom variables and metrics.
* There are cases where those streams could crash that have been also fixed.
