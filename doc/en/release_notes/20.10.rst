Bugs

Builds
======
Build on Centos8 fixed.

Retention files
===============
The splitter class is now thread safe and does not need external locks anymore.
It is also far less strict and allows some reading and some writing at the same
time.

Enhancements
************

Command line argument
=====================
It is now possible to set the cbd pool size directly on the command line with
the --pool_size X argument or -s X.

Statistics
==========
The thread pool has now its own statistics. For now, we have two informations
that are the number of threads it contains and its latency in milliseconds that
is the duration we have to wait to see a task executed. We post a task to the
thread pool at time T1, it is executed by the thread pool at time T2, the
latency is T2 - T1.
