# Changelog

## Centreon Broker 20.10.4

`Release date to be defined`

### Bugfixes

*Log file configuration*

log file configuration is applied even if the configuration contains errors.
Now '.' is allowed in names.

*Broker termination*

When broker is badly configured and the user wants to stop it, it may hang and
never stop. This new version fixes this issue.

*Storage rebuilder*

The rebuilder loop has been rewritten. When it is stopped, it is interrupted
correctly.

*Logs*

The new logs (log_v2) are correctly flushed when cbd is stopped.

*Thread pool*

The thread pool is better stopped now.

*Cache/Retention files*

They are written well written as expected. Before, we could see some of them
not written at all.

*Sigterm handler*

It is better managed, so event if several SIGTERM are received by cbd, it stops
correctly.

*Diagnostic/Check modes*

The diagnostic and the check modes are back and functional.

## 20.10.3

`January 20, 2021`

### Bugfixes

*Conflict manager and comments*

It is possible to lock the database during comments insertion. This new
version fixes that.

*BAM reporting dimensions computation*

If there are retention files, dimensions computation could fail because of
conflicts between new block computation and old ones (the ones in the
retention). There was also an issue of concurrent access to tables during
dimensions computation.

*BAM availabilities rebuild*

When availabilities are rebuilt, durations can be doubled. This new version
fixes this issue.

### Enhancements

*Logs*

Logs are sent to the database in bulk as we already do for customvariables.

*Lua*

There is a new API available for the Lua connector. To use it, scripts
must declare a global variable `broker_api_version=2`. From the user's
point of view, Stream Connectors should work almost the same. In isolate
cases, we could see scripts that do not work with this new API, then you
can always work with Broker API version 1, by setting the variable to 1
or by removing this variable declaration in the script. Why should we
use the v2 version? Because it is faster, really faster.

*TCP connections*

If the connection between two peers is flapping, it may be difficult for one
to reconnect to the other and this could lead to many CLOSE_WAIT on the
acceptor side. This new version fixes this issue.

## 20.10.2

`December 16, 2020`

> Known behaviours:
>
>   - If TLS encryption is configured to use private key/certificate couple
>     for IPv4/6 input/output endpoints, **both ends must be updated**
>     to ensure communication.
>
>   - If you use Centreon MAP with TLS encryption, make sure to **update MAP
>     server** to version >= 20.10.2.

### Bugfixes

*TLS*

Credentials were not loaded by the TLS connector anymore. This is fixed
with this new version.

*Custom variables*

They were updated several times in the database. It is fixed now.

*Build*

GnuTLS requirement now matches compilation version.

*BAM*

Reporting events were not stored into database because of truncated
Business Activities names causing *duplicate entry* errors.

## 20.10.1

`November 25, 2020`

### Bugfixes

*Build*

Build on Centos8 fixed.

*Retention files*

The splitter class is now thread safe and does not need external locks
anymore. It is also far less strict and allows some reading and some
writing at the same time.

*TCP*

Writing on a tcp stream could slow down in case of many retention files. The
issue was essentially in the flush internal function.

### Enhancements

*TCP connections*

TCP streams are really faster, especially when Broker has retention
files and there are a lot of traffic.

*SQL and storage streams*

Those streams have several improvements:

- Events exchanges are much faster, especially when Broker has
  retention files.
- Several queries have been changed to insert data in bulk, it is
  the case for custom variables and metrics.
- There are cases where those streams could crash that have been
  also fixed.

*Statistics*

The thread pool has now its own statistics. For now, we have two
informations that are the number of threads it contains and its latency
in milliseconds that is the duration we have to wait to see a task
executed. We post a task to the thread pool at time T1, it is executed
by the thread pool at time T2, the latency is T2 - T1.

*Command line argument*

It is now possible to set the cbd pool size directly on the command line
with the â€“pool\_size X argument or -s X.

## 20.10.0

`October 21, 2020`

> Known behaviours:
>
>   - If Broker on a Poller or Remote Server is not upgraded to 20.10
>     (or with a version prior to 20.04.9), the communication between said
>     Poller or Remote Server and an upgraded Central may not work.
>
>     As always, we **strongly recommend** to upgrade all components to match
>     the Central server's version.
>
>     However, during an upgrade process, communication can be maintained
>     by making sure Broker's configurations match the following conditions:
>
>     - *TLS encryption* and *compression* are either set to
>       *Auto* or *No* on Central input,
>     - *TLS encryption* and *compression* are either set to
>       *Auto* or *No* on Poller or Remote Server output.
>
>     If the reversed connection mode (*one peer retention*) is used,
>     the Broker upgrade is mandatory.

### Enhancements

*Watchdog*

The watchdog is lighter and does no more need all the broker libraries.

### Bugfixes

- Contains all fixes up to version 20.04.9
